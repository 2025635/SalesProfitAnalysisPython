Title: Sales and Profit Visualization over Years

Description:
This Python mini-project utilizes the Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas libraries to generate sample data representing sales and profit over a period of years. The dataset includes information on the yearly sales and corresponding profits. The project creates a figure and axis using Matplotlib, plotting a bar graph for sales (x-axis: year, y-axis: profit) in a sky-blue color. Additionally, it plots a line graph for profit (x-axis: year, y-axis: profit) overlaying the bar graph. The visualization is enhanced with labels for the x-axis (year), y-axis (amount), and a title indicating "Sales and Profit over Years". This project provides a clear visual representation of the sales and profit trends over time.
